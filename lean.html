        <h2>Lean history</h2>
        <p align="justify">The history of lean methodology can be traced back to the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in the 1950s. At the time, Toyota faced significant challenges in manufacturing due to limited resources and a competitive market.

            To address these challenges, Toyota developed a new approach to manufacturing that focused on reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving quality. This approach, known as TPS, was based on the principles of continuous improvement, respect for people, and just-in-time production.
            
            One of the key figures in the development of TPS was Taiichi Ohno, a Toyota engineer who helped to create many of the key concepts and tools used in lean methodology today. Ohno developed the concept of the "Toyota Production System House", which visualized the principles and practices of TPS as a structured framework for manufacturing.
            
            Over the years, TPS and lean methodology have been adopted by many other companies and industries around the world. In the 1980s, lean principles were applied to software development, leading to the creation of Agile methodology. Today, lean methodology is used in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, logistics, and service industries.
            
            The spread of lean methodology has been driven in part by the success of companies that have adopted it. Companies such as Toyota, Amazon, and Intel have used lean principles to achieve significant improvements in efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction. This success has helped to popularize lean methodology as a powerful approach to business management.</p>

        <h2>Principles of lean methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous improvement: Always strive to improve processes and eliminate waste.</li>
            <li>Respect for people: Empower and involve employees in the process of improvement.</li>
            <li>Focus on value: Focus on delivering value to customers, and eliminate activities that do not add value.</li>
            <li>Flow and pull: Optimize processes to achieve a continuous flow of value and respond to customer demand.</li>
            <li>Visual management: Make processes and progress visible through tools such as Kanban boards and process maps.</li>
            <li>Just-in-time production: Deliver products or services just in time to meet customer demand, and avoid excess inventory or waste.</li>
            <li>Standardization: Create standardized processes and procedures to reduce variation and waste.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">Lean methodology involves a cycle of continuous improvement known as the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. This involves planning a process, implementing it, checking its effectiveness, and making improvements based on the results.

            Overall, the goal of lean methodology is to create a culture of continuous improvement, where employees are empowered to identify and eliminate waste, and focus on delivering value to customers.</p>
