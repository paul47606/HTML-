        <p align="justify">Sustainability indicators and composite index are increasingly recognised as a useful tool for policy making and public communication in conveying information on countries and corporate performance in fields such as environment, economy, society, or technological improvement. By visualizing phenomena and highlighting trends, sustainability indicators simplify, quantify, analyse and communicate otherwise complex and complicated information. Sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or achieve a state of balance and harmony between economic, social, and environmental factors over the long term. It is the idea that we must meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is a complex and multidimensional concept that encompasses a wide range of issues, including climate change, biodiversity loss, resource depletion, social inequality, and economic instability. Achieving sustainability requires a systemic approach that considers the interconnections between environmental, social, and economic systems. </p>
        <p align="justify">Suinability is becoming increasingly important in today's world as we face significant environmental and social challenges, such as climate change, pollution, poverty, and inequality. Many organizations, governments, and individuals are working towards achieving sustainability through various initiatives, policies, and practices. Some key principles of sustainability include reducing waste and pollution, conserving natural resources, promoting social justice and equity, supporting local communities, and fostering economic growth that is environmentally and socially responsible. Achieving sustainability requires collective action and collaboration across all sectors of society. <hr></p>
        <h3>Some Key points on sustainability:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Environmental stewardship: This involves managing natural resources, reducing waste and pollution, and protecting ecosystems to minimize negative impacts on the environment.</li>
            <li>Social responsibility: This involves taking care of the needs and interests of stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and other groups affected by a business's operations.</li>
            <li>Economic viability: This involves creating long-term economic value by balancing financial performance with social and environmental responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Innovation: This involves developing new products, services, and business models that promote sustainability and address environmental and social challenges.</li>
            <li>Collaboration: This involves working with other organizations, governments, and stakeholders to achieve sustainability goals and address global challenges.</li>
            <li>Transparency: This involves being open and honest about a business's social and environmental impact, goals, and progress towards achieving sustainability.</li>
            <li>Accountability: This involves taking responsibility for a business's social and environmental impact and ensuring that appropriate measures are in place to address negative impacts.</li>
            <li>Circular economy: This involves minimizing waste and resource use by designing products and processes that are regenerative, restorative, and waste-free.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Developments related to sustainability in recent years:</h3>
        <lu>
            <li>2015: Adoption of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</li>
            <li>2015: Signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change</li>
            <li>2016: The Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force</li>
            <li>2018: The European Union banned single-use plastics</li>
            <li>2019: Global Climate Strikes led by youth activist Greta Thunberg</li>

        <h3>Sustainability life cycle</h3>
        <p>Sustainability life cycle refers to the concept of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of a product, process, or service over its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. This approach takes into account the full range of environmental and social impacts associated with a product or service, including its production, transportation, use, and disposal.</p>
        <h3>Life cycle assessment (LCA) </h3>
        <p align="justify">A life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool that is commonly used to evaluate the sustainability life cycle of a product or service. LCA involves a comprehensive analysis of the environmental, social, and economic impacts associated with a product or service, including its raw materials, energy use, water use, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions. By evaluating the sustainability life cycle of a product or service, businesses and individuals can identify areas where improvements can be made to reduce environmental and social impacts and increase economic efficiency. This can lead to more sustainable products and services that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>

        <p align="justify">Sustainability is a critical issue that affects every aspect of our lives, including the environment, economy, and social justice. It refers to the ability to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Achieving sustainability requires a balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social well-being. To promote sustainability, individuals, businesses, and governments need to adopt sustainable practices such as reducing waste, conserving resources, and promoting renewable energy. It is also important to address social issues such as poverty, inequality, and access to education and healthcare, as these can impact the ability of communities to thrive sustainably. In conclusion, sustainability is a complex issue that requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders. By working together to promote sustainable practices, we can ensure a better future for ourselves and future generations.</p><hr>
